#Tech

Hi, again, it is me. Half year's ago, I wrote a page to list all silicon valley technolgies while I was looking for the job. 
Yeah, I just out from my previous job and looking for new oppotunities right now, and there are a lot of changing over here.
I gonna show you later.

## GTD
1. GitHub to page 
Well, github is a great text storage space actually, I found that some has done so. Use github as CMS, which is a great idea. 
I would try that, too.

2. C9 IDE
C9 project used to be one of Mozilla's, but it is indpendent right now, and has awesome update IDE with beautiful design 
and powerfull server. I gonna work on that one.

3. Wordpress and Drupal
Since now, there are still many project based on those out of date system, well... gonna catch those two up a little bit later.
Yep, the clients are always the god. We gonna serve them well.
