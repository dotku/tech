# tech

I might want to write a book about dev tech.

## Reminde me of old 2015

2015 was the time I moved from China to the US again.
It was time quite tech booming by then. Quite a lot of new frameworks
are released inlcuding Angular (2016), Bootstrap (2011), Laravel (2011).

Yeah, my US tech journey starts from there. Joined Overseas Credit,
BlueJay Mobile and Meta really save my career life; however, I didn't 
pay too much attension on it. I just know Meta is hard, hard to surrive.
I was escpaed, and joined Huawei Technologies. Huawei's project was great;
however, it was closed out, feel so said, and current Intuit AI is a 
great project too, but my family need feed, we need money. It is not about
myself satification. My family need my support. And again, I come back to Meta.

Wish everything would go well soon.

Best,
