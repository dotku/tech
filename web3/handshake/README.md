# Handshake

Handshake is a domain name service based on HNS token. There are still quite number of 
TLD (Top Level Domain) avaiable on HNS. However, not all service or browser support HNS
yet.

There are few ways you can access handshake domains, one easy way might be install
[fingertip](https://impervious.com/fingertip); however, itsn't a perfect solution either,
since handshake is just not industrial ready.

For pre experience the current handshake domain community, I just registered a handshack domain
[http://gh.ds](http://gh.ds) for github redirect purpose. If you want to visit the site, please
make sure you installed figertip.

On the other hand related to the token world in ecent few month, it sounds like BTC is comming back. 
Would BTC go up to 100k this time? We will it out soon!
