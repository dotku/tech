# GitHub

## Static Site Generator: Jeckyll

[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) is the default template engine on github, 
even though the new project leader [Frank Taillandier](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/14/goodbye-dear-frank/)
annouced frozen of Jeckyll in 2019. So far GitHub page is still using Jeckyll 3.0 (the newest one 
is 4.0). I don't know what it should be. It gonna be a solution.

Maybe github action could be something I can work on. It has quite high limit on running up to 6 hours.
I think that could be engough for many repository.

Will find a time on it.

## URL Setting, Should We Use Lowercase?

It looks like we should always use lower case on the URL at GitHub, cause repo naming is lowercase.
When repo naming match the doc title, it won't show double title.
