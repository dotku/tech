## Template Engine: Jeckyll

[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) is the default template engine on github, 
even though the new project leader [Frank Taillandier](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/14/goodbye-dear-frank/)
annouced frozen of Jeckyll in 2019. So far GitHub page is still using Jeckyll 3.0 (the newest one 
is 4.0). I don't know what it should be. It gonna be a solution.

Maybe github action could be something I can work on. It has quite high limit on running up to 6 hours.
I think that could be engough for many repository.

Will find a time on it.
