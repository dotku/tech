## Static Site Generators

Other then Jekyll, there are several other options for static site generating. Here is an incomplete
list:

- Astro (2022)  
  This one looks nice.

- Vuepress (September 5, 2019)  
  Vue based site generator.

- 11ty (Dec 4, 2017)  
  Said to be the official replacement of Jekyll.

- Gatsby (June 15th, 2017)  
  It is more React style generator with MDX support that support GraphQL?!

- MkDocs (October 29, 2014)  
  I actually like MkDocs, markdown based post is great.

- Ghost (September 19, 2013)  
  It start charge fee, and there is no free plan anymore, starts from $9?!

- Hugo (July 5, 2013)  
  Hugo looks okay, I found few communities, eg [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) using similar markdown template,
  not sure if they are using the same.

- Hexo (Jul 3, 2013)  
  Hexo official website right now is full of Google AD. Not sure if the authors/community is facing any
  financial difficulty. The bad user experience would hurt the Hexo community.

- Sphinx (March 21, 2008)  
  This doc template is quite acdamical.

- WordPress (2003)  
  This defenitily not a good option. It is kind overkilled.

## Static Site Generator: Jeckyll

[Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)) is the default template engine on github, 
even though the new project leader [Frank Taillandier](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/14/goodbye-dear-frank/)
annouced frozen of Jeckyll in 2019. So far GitHub page is still using Jeckyll 3.0 (the newest one 
is 4.0). I don't know what it should be. It gonna be a solution.

Maybe github action could be something I can work on. It has quite high limit on running up to 6 hours.
I think that could be engough for many repository.

Will find a time on it.
